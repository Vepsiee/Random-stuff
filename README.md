# Random-stuff
I will just post random stuff here.
I will most likely add anything, ranging from stuff i did with no tutorials, to stuff that doesnt even work. I will always use python, as i am a beginner coder.
***If you want to run the diskfiller virus, you need to download the extras.py file and put them in the same directory or they wont work***

Delete extra.py, put extra.py contents into diskfiller.py as 2 files were not necessary, Added extra security (Are you sure input) (Diskfiller currently not working, will work soon :) )

Updated and fixed diskfiller virus, will fill your disk up with anywhere between 1 - 10000 self-replicating python files. ***Tested on kali but that didint do anything but still, use at own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused.***
